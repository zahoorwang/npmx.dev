# Governance

This document outlines the governance model for npmx. This includes descriptions of different roles, nomination processes, code review processes, and Code of Conduct enforcement.

**All community members must follow the [Code of Conduct (CoC)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**

## Get Involved

**Anything that supports the npmx community is a valuable contribution!**

All types of contribution are meaningful. This can include code changes, type fixes, Discord activity, and even posting about npmx to your personal blog. No contribution is too small!

Anyone can become an npmx contributor. Engineering ability is not required. Our goal is to recognize all contributors to the project regardless of skill, experience or background.

## Roles

Each contributor role comes with a set of privileges and responsibilities, and they are granted for as long as the individual wishes to engage with the project. Contributors can voluntarily leave the project at any time.

### Contributor

Have you done something (big or small) to contribute to the health, success, or growth of npmx? Congratulations, you're officially recognized as a **Contributor** to the project! Examples of recognized contributions are helping on the repo, chat, and social. But also blogging, podcasting, and livestreaming about npmx.

This role does not require any extra responsibilities nor time commitment. We hope you stick around and keep participating in our community!

### Maintainer

The **Maintainer** role is available to contributors who want to join the team and take part in the long-term maintenance and growth of npmx. This role is critical to the long-term health of npmx. Maintainers act as the first line of defense when it comes to new issues, pull requests and chat activity.

Maintainers are not required to write code! Some Maintainers spend most of their time inside of our chat, maintaining a healthy community there. Others work on technical documentation, support, or design. There is no strict minimum number of contributions needed to reach this level, as long as you can show sustained involvement over time.

### Core

The **Core** role is available to community members who have a larger-than-usual impact on the npmx project and community. They are seen as leaders in the project and are listened to by the wider npmx community, often before they have even reached this level. A Core member is recognized for contributing a significant amount of time and energy to the project through issues, pull requests, bug fixes, implementing advanced features, or actively posting on our chat.

Not every contributor will reach this level, and that's okay! Maintainers still have significant responsibility and privileges within our community.

### Project Steward

**Stewards** control and maintain sensitive project asset and assist in shaping the direction and vision of the project. We aim to act with consensus within the core team, but stewards can resolve disagreements when needed. Stewards act in the project's best interest and should be an example for the rest of the community. New Stewards are added based on a unanimous vote by the existing Stewards.

The npmx project Stewards are currently:

- **Daniel Roe** ([website](https://roe.dev), [social](https://bsky.app/profile/danielroe.dev), [github](https://github.com/danielroe), [@danielroe](https://chat.npmx.dev))
- **Matias Capeletto** ([website](https://patak.dev), [social](https://bsky.app/profile/patak.dev), [github](https://github.com/patak-dev), [@patak.dev](https://chat.npmx.dev))
